# Onboarding and VC Creation Process

## Overview

1. **CSP (Customer Service Provider)**:
   - Initiates the process by requesting a new VC.
   - Submits the required documentation for the VC.
   - Receives notifications about documentation revisions and the final VC creation.

2. **Maintainer of VCs**:
   - Generates the VC once all documentation is approved.
   - Sends information about the newly created VC to the CSP.

3. **Legal**:
   - Reviews the submitted documentation for the VC.
   - Decides whether the documentation is satisfactory or requires revisions.

## Process Steps

1. **New VC Request (CSP)**:
   - The process starts when the CSP requests the creation of a new VC.
   - This triggers the first user task for the CSP to submit the required documentation.

2. **Submit Documentation for VC (CSP)**:
   - The CSP submits the necessary documentation for the VC.
   - Once submitted, the process sends a message indicating that the documentation has been submitted.

3. **Documentation Review (Legal)**:
   - The Legal team receives a notification that documentation has been submitted for review.
   - Legal reviews the documentation to ensure it meets all requirements.

4. **Documentation Decision**:
   - If the documentation is satisfactory, the process proceeds with VC creation approval.
   - If the documentation is not satisfactory, Legal sends information about the required revisions back to the CSP.

5. **Send Documentation Revision Request (Legal)**:
   - If revisions are needed, Legal sends a message to the CSP indicating the necessary changes.
   - The CSP updates and resubmits the documentation as required.

6. **Documentation Approval**:
   - Once Legal approves the documentation, a message is sent indicating the VC creation is approved.

7. **Generate VC (Maintainer of VCs)**:
   - The Maintainer of VCs generates the VC based on the approved documentation.
   - The generated VC information is then sent to the CSP.

8. **Send VC Information to CSP (Maintainer of VCs)**:
   - The Maintainer sends a notification to the CSP with the details of the newly created VC.

9. **VC Creation Complete**:
   - The process concludes with the successful creation and delivery of the VC to the CSP.
